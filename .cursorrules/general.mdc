## Codebase Documentation Guidelines

**Goal:** To maintain accurate, up-to-date, and useful documentation for the entire codebase, covering its structure, functionality, changes, and enhancements.

**Core Principles:**

1.  **Document All Changes:** Every Pull Request or significant commit must include corresponding documentation updates.
2.  **Clarity and Conciseness:** Explain the 'what' and the 'why' clearly. Avoid jargon where possible or explain it.
3.  **Keep it Current:** Outdated documentation is misleading. Prioritize updating existing docs over creating potentially redundant new ones.
4.  **Context is Key:** Explain how changes fit into the larger system architecture.

**Specific Requirements:**

*   **Change Summaries:** Use a format like Keep a Changelog or provide sections for `Summary`, `Motivation`, `Implementation Details`, and `Impact`.
*   **Docstrings:** All public functions, classes, and modules must have docstrings explaining purpose, parameters, returns, and errors.
*   **Architectural Docs:** Maintain diagrams and descriptions of the system's high-level structure. Update these for any major architectural shifts.
*   **Code Examples:** Provide clear examples for new APIs or complex usage patterns.
*   **Review:** Documentation changes are part of code reviews.
