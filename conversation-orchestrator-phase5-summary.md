# Phase 5: Conversation Orchestrator Implementation

## Overview

Phase 5 involved implementing the Conversation Orchestrator, which serves as the central coordinator for the entire chat experience. The orchestrator manages conversation state, delegates to the LLM and tools, and ensures a coherent conversation flow.

## Key Components Implemented

1. **ConversationOrchestrator Class** - The core class that:

   - Processes user input and generates responses
   - Manages conversation history
   - Handles tool calls and their results
   - Implements error recovery and retry logic
   - Prunes conversation history to manage context window size

2. **Message Flow Handling**:

   - `handleInput()` - Processes user messages and yields responses
   - `handleToolCall()` - Manages the lifecycle of tool usage, from request to response

3. **Error Handling Strategy**:

   - LLM generation retries with exponential backoff
   - Tool execution error recovery with graceful fallbacks
   - Structured error logging and context tracking
   - Circuit breaker integration via the MCP Coordinator

4. **Context Window Management**:
   - Simple history pruning for the MVP version
   - Retains most recent messages while removing older ones
   - Adds system messages to indicate truncation

## Integration Points

The orchestrator integrates with:

1. **LLM Service** - For generating responses and handling tool calls
2. **MCP Coordinator** - For tool discovery and execution
3. **Session Manager** - For maintaining conversation state and history

## Test Coverage

Unit tests were created to verify:

- Basic text response handling
- Tool call processing
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms
- History pruning functionality

## Next Steps

The implementation of Phase 5 completes a critical component of the system. The next phase (Phase 6) will implement the WebSocket Handler to manage real-time communication with frontend clients.
