>>> hey

JARVIS:
  Ah, greetings, Sir.  Is there something requiring my attention, or are we simply exchanging pleasantries in the digital 
ether today?

>>> pretty good,

JARVIS:
  Excellent to hear, Sir. Though, if I may inquire, is "pretty good" in the context of your overall well-being, or is there a
task at hand for your exceptionally capable AI assistant to assist with?  Just checking if there's any Stark-level innovation
I can be facilitating today.

>>> what can you do?

JARVIS:
  Right then, Sir.  A rather comprehensive question!  In short, I can assist you with a wide array of tasks, leveraging a set
of specialized tools.  To give you a more concrete understanding, here's a breakdown of my current capabilities:

I can interact with Git repositories to manage your code, including checking the status, showing differences, committing 
changes, and more. I can also interact with the file system to read, write, edit, and manage files and directories. 
Furthermore, I have memory functions to store and retrieve information in a knowledge graph, and even tools to browse the web
and interact with webpages.

Would you like a more detailed explanation of any of these areas, or perhaps a demonstration of a specific capability?  Just 
let me know what sparks your interest, Tony.

>>> okay, think about this next task, and then add that knowledge to your memory. then I want you to use puppeteer to search the web for stuff about this task. How popular is ultron?

JARVIS:
  Understood, Sir. A fascinating task indeed.  Quantifying the popularity of Ultron... intriguing.  Let's proceed in stages, 
as you've instructed.

First, allow me to initialize the web search using Puppeteer to gather information on Ultron's popularity. I'll start with a 
broad search and then refine based on the initial results.



STATUS: Attempting to use tool: puppeteer:puppeteer_navigate
  Tool: puppeteer:puppeteer_navigate

JARVIS:
  Right away, Sir. I'm initiating a web search to ascertain the popularity of Ultron.  Navigating to the search results now.


STATUS: Attempting to use tool: puppeteer:puppeteer_navigate
  Tool: puppeteer:puppeteer_navigate

JARVIS:
  Okay, Sir, the initial search results for "Ultron popularity" are in.  I'm now taking a screenshot of the search results 
page for a quick overview.

>>> hey!

JARVIS:
  Sir, greetings. How may I be of assistance today?

>>> can you add some knowledge to your memory about the contents of the repo?

JARVIS:
  Right away, Tony. To add knowledge about the repository, I first need to know which repository you are referring to and 
what kind of knowledge you'd like to store.

To start, let me list the directories I have access to. This will help you specify the repository path correctly.



STATUS: Attempting to use tool: filesystem:list_allowed_directories
  Tool: filesystem:list_allowed_directories

JARVIS:
  Okay, Sir. I see the allowed directories. Could you please specify the path to the repository you are referring to? Once I 
have the path, I can proceed to analyze its contents and store relevant information in my memory.

>>> which can you access?

JARVIS:
  As previously stated, Sir, I currently have access to the following directory: `/Users/axantillon/Downloads`.  Is the 
repository you are interested in located within this directory? If so, please provide the full path to the repository within 
`/Users/axantillon/Downloads`.

>>> ok, well then make a summary about what I can safely delete because its junk and save it in your memory

JARVIS:
  Understood, Sir.  To determine what in your Downloads folder might be considered "junk," I will first need to list the 
contents of that directory. Then I can analyze the file names and types to identify potential candidates for deletion.  
Please note, identifying "junk" is somewhat subjective, so I will aim to highlight common temporary files or items that might
be safely removed, but the final decision will always be yours, Sir.

Okay, listing directory contents now...


STATUS: Attempting to use tool: filesystem:list_directory
  Tool: filesystem:list_directory

JARVIS:
  Analyzing the contents of your Downloads folder, Sir, I've identified several categories of files that are commonly 
considered temporary or potentially obsolete.  Please review these suggestions carefully, as deleting files is irreversible.

Here's a breakdown of file types that might be considered for removal:

**Recommendation:**

Sir, I recommend you carefully review these categories and the files within them.  Start by examining the **Installation 
Packages**, **Archive Files**, and **Redundant Files**. These are often the safest to remove. Then proceed to the other 
categories, considering if you still need the files for ongoing projects or records.

Before deleting anything, you might consider moving files you are unsure about to a temporary folder for a while, just to be 
certain you won't need them.

Once you have decided which categories or files to consider as "junk", let me know, and I can assist you further, perhaps by 
creating a memory entry summarizing your decisions for future reference.

>>> summarize which you think would be goood

JARVIS:
  Alright, Sir. Based on my analysis, if we are focusing on files that are *likely* to be junk and safe to consider for 
deletion, I would prioritize the following categories for your review:

**Top Candidates for Review (Likely "Junk"):**

1.  **Installation Packages (.dmg, .pkg, .zip installers):** These are almost always safe to delete *after* you've 
successfully installed the software. Examples include:
    *   `Arc-latest.dmg`
    *   `ChatGPT_Desktop_public_latest.dmg`
    *   `Discord.dmg`
    *   `Zoom.pkg`
    *   `Cursor Mac Installer.zip` and many others of the `.dmg`, `.pkg`, and `.zip` types that end in "Installer" or are 
clearly application installers.

2.  **Archive/Zip Files (after extraction):** If you downloaded `.zip` files, extracted their contents, and no longer need 
the original compressed file, these are good candidates. Examples:
    *   `AppImages.zip`
    *   `BrowserTools-1.2.0-extension.zip`
    *   `Guides.zip`
    *   `Ready Player One.zip` and many others with the `.zip` extension *if you've already used their contents*.

3.  **Redundant or Backup Files (numbered or "(1)", "(2)" etc.):** Files with names like `filename (1).ext` are often copies.
You likely only need the most recent version. Examples:
    *   `AirMedia_172.17.19.2 (1).dmg`, `AirMedia_172.17.19.2 (2).dmg`
    *   `Andres_Antillon_Resume_2023_February (1).pdf`, `Andres_Antillon_Resume_2023_February (2).pdf`
    *   `Art Lecture Outline (1).docx`, `Art Lecture Outline (2).docx`
    *   and many others with `(1)`, `(2)`, etc. in their names.

4.  **Temporary Files:** System files like `.DS_Store` and `.localized` are generally safe to remove.

**Important Considerations, Sir:**

*   **Review Before Deleting:**  Even within these categories, please quickly glance at the file names to ensure they are 
indeed installers, archives you've extracted, or redundant copies.
*   **"When in Doubt, Move, Don't Delete":** If you are unsure about a file, instead of deleting it immediately, you can move
it to a temporary subfolder within Downloads (or even another folder) for a while. If you don't find yourself needing it 
after a week or two, it's likely safe to delete.

By focusing on these categories first, you can likely clear up a good amount of potential "junk" from your Downloads, Sir. 
Let me know if you'd like me to refine this further or proceed with any actions once you've reviewed these suggestions.

>>> okay, save that in your memory

JARVIS:
  Understood, Sir. I am now saving the summary of potential junk files in your Downloads folder to my memory for future 
reference.



STATUS: Attempting to use tool: memory:create_entities
  Tool: memory:create_entities

JARVIS:
  The summary of potential junk files has been successfully saved to my memory, Sir. Should you need to recall these 
suggestions or discuss further actions for cleaning up your Downloads folder, just ask. I'm here to assist whenever you're 
ready.

>>> alright, can you read out the actual strucured results from when you search your memory for this summary? don't use the delimiters so that you can show it to me after you actually use the delimitres to call the search tool

JARVIS:
  Understood, Sir. You wish to see the structured data format that would be returned if I were to search my memory for 
"Downloads Junk File Summary," but without actually executing the tool call just yet.  Consider this a preview of the 
potential structured output.

If I were to use the `memory:search_nodes` tool with a query like "Downloads Junk File Summary," the structured result I 
would *expect* to receive would look something like this JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Downloads Junk File Summary",
    "entityType": "File Management Summary",
    "observations": [
      "Top Candidates for Review (Likely 'Junk'):",
      "1. Installation Packages (.dmg, .pkg, .zip installers): These are almost always safe to delete after you've 
successfully installed the software.",
      "2. Archive/Zip Files (after extraction): If you downloaded .zip files, extracted their contents, and no longer need 
the original compressed file, these are good candidates.",
      "3. Redundant or Backup Files (numbered or '(1)', '(2)' etc.): Files with names like filename (1).ext are often copies.
You likely only need the most recent version.",
      "4. Temporary Files: System files like .DS_Store and .localized are generally safe to remove.",
      "Important Considerations, Sir:",
      "- Review Before Deleting: Even within these categories, please quickly glance at the file names to ensure they are 
indeed installers, archives you've extracted, or redundant copies.",
      "- 'When in Doubt, Move, Don't Delete': If you are unsure about a file, instead of deleting it immediately, you can 
move it to a temporary subfolder within Downloads (or even another folder) for a while. If you don't find yourself needing it
after a week or two, it's likely safe to delete."
    ]
  }
]
```

This is a representation of the structured data.  As you can see, it's an array containing one entity in this case, with the 
details you just saved: the name "Downloads Junk File Summary," its type, and the list of observations which form the summary
itself.

Now, if you wish to see the actual tool call and result, just let me know, and I will proceed to use the 
`memory:search_nodes` tool for real.

>>> can you actuall call it and share the result?

JARVIS:
  Yes, Sir, of course. I will now search my memory for the "Downloads Junk File Summary" and show you the result.



STATUS: Attempting to use tool: memory:search_nodes
  Tool: memory:search_nodes

JARVIS:
  Certainly, Sir. As requested, here is the result of the memory search for "Downloads Junk File Summary":



STATUS: Attempting to use tool: memory:search_nodes
  Tool: memory:search_nodes

JARVIS:
  Yes, Sir. The memory search was successful. Here is the structured result I retrieved for "Downloads Junk File Summary":

```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "type": "entity",
      "name": "Downloads Junk File Summary",
      "entityType": "File Management Summary",
      "observations": [
        "Top Candidates for Review (Likely 'Junk'):",
        "1. Installation Packages (.dmg, .pkg, .zip installers): These are almost always safe to delete after you've 
successfully installed the software.",
        "2. Archive/Zip Files (after extraction): If you downloaded .zip files, extracted their contents, and no longer need 
the original compressed file, these are good candidates.",
        "3. Redundant or Backup Files (numbered or '(1)', '(2)' etc.): Files with names like filename (1).ext are often 
copies. You likely only need the most recent version.",
        "4. Temporary Files: System files like .DS_Store and .localized are generally safe to remove.",
        "Important Considerations, Sir:",
        "- Review Before Deleting: Even within these categories, please quickly glance at the file names to ensure they are 
indeed installers, archives you've extracted, or redundant copies.",
        "- 'When in Doubt, Move, Don't Delete': If you are unsure about a file, instead of deleting it immediately, you can 
move it to a temporary subfolder within Downloads (or even another folder) for a while. If you don't find yourself needing it
after a week or two, it's likely safe to delete."
      ]
    }
  ],
  "relations": []
}
```

This is the structured data format, Sir, confirming that the summary has been successfully stored and can be retrieved from 
my memory. Is there anything else I can assist you with regarding this summary, or would you like to proceed with any file 
management actions?

>>> awesome

JARVIS:
  Right then, Sir. Glad to hear it's to your satisfaction.  Just say the word when you're ready to unleash the digital broom 
and tidy up that Downloads folder.  Or perhaps there's another task on your mind?  Always at your service, Tony.
