# MCP Coordinator - Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Phase 2 implementation of the LaserFocus Host Server focuses on the MCP Coordinator, a core component responsible for managing connections to MCP servers, discovering tools, and handling tool execution requests. This implementation follows the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification and provides a robust, reliable way to interact with MCP servers.

## Implementation Details

The implementation includes the following files:

- `src/core/mcp/MCPCoordinator.ts` - Main implementation of the MCP Coordinator
- `src/core/mcp/utils/generateFallbackPrompt.ts` - Utility for generating fallback tool descriptions
- `src/core/mcp/index.ts` - Exports for the MCP Coordinator
- `src/types/mcp.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for MCP-related types
- `src/types/mcp-sdk.d.ts` - Type definitions for the MCP SDK
- `tests/unit/core/mcp.test.ts` - Unit tests for the MCP Coordinator
- `tests/integration/mcp.test.ts` - Integration tests for the MCP Coordinator

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Server Connection Management**:

   - Support for multiple MCP servers
   - Support for both stdio and HTTP transports
   - Connection lifecycle management (initialization, monitoring, shutdown)

2. **Tool Discovery and Registration**:

   - Automatic discovery of tools from connected servers
   - Handling of tool name collisions with qualified names (serverId:toolName)
   - Tool registry with metadata and performance tracking

3. **Tool Description Management**:

   - Retrieval of tool-descriptions prompts from servers
   - Fallback prompt generation when server doesn't provide descriptions
   - LLM-friendly tool documentation generation

4. **Tool Execution**:

   - Tool argument validation against JSON Schema
   - Support for timeouts and abort signals
   - Error handling and formatting

5. **Reliability Features**:
   - Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
   - Performance metrics tracking
   - Request tracking and abort functionality

## Testing

The implementation includes both unit tests and integration tests:

- **Unit tests**: Test MCP Coordinator functions in isolation with mocked MCP SDK
- **Integration tests**: Test the coordinator with real MCP servers (skipped if no servers available)

All tests are passing successfully.

## Configuration

The MCP Coordinator uses a JSON configuration file (default: `mcp.json`) with the following structure:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "server_id": {
      "id": "server_id",
      "name": "Server Name",
      "description": "Description of the server",
      "type": "local" | "remote",
      "transport": "stdio" | "http",
      "command": "executable", // For stdio transport
      "args": ["arg1", "arg2"], // For stdio transport
      "url": "http://example.com" // For http transport
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with LLM Orchestrator**:

   - Connect the MCP Coordinator to the LLM Orchestrator
   - Provide tool descriptions to LLMs

2. **API Endpoints**:

   - Create REST endpoints for tool discovery and execution

3. **Monitoring and Management**:

   - Add detailed monitoring and logging
   - Provide management interfaces

4. **Extended Tool Support**:
   - Add support for more MCP tool servers
   - Implement caching of tool responses

The MCP Coordinator is now ready for integration into the overall LaserFocus Host Server architecture.
